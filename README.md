# PORTFOLIO

This repository contains all the files that build my porftfolio. Many of the projects have been part of some academical curriculum, and many other have been concieved out of my eagerness for continuous development. The main objective is to showcase relevant data science
projects carried out on my own. Evidently, these projects have had a big impact on my self learning path towards excelency. The ultimate goal is to be a complete and robust data scientist who can greatly help executive teams in decission making.
